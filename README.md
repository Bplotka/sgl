# sgl

## What?

Simplistic Go logging library that focused only what's important!

## Why? 

Most of the existing libraries have too many features and in the same way lacking of feature that 
was important in my point of view. I would love to use std one.. but it is too simple (: (waiting for update in next versions of Go).

So why using unsuitable one, if you can write your own based on your experience and good habits?

## How?

Inspired by [logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus), [this](https://dave.cheney.net/2015/11/05/lets-talk-about-logging) post and lots of internal loggers I had occasion to use.
